Why Flutter?

Flutter is a cross plateform effecient framework in building amazing mobile application. Flutter is faster than many other application development frameworks. With its “hot reload” feature, you can experiment, build UIs, add/remove features, test and fix bugs faster. Thus reducing the overall app development time.

My Archictecture and Model choice Since this is a simple application, I made use of the setstate method to manage my state management. And ALso made use of the Provider pasckage to manage data. I am proficient in Provider and have considerable knowledge in Bloc/Cubit.

I Seperated my files into Models, Services/Helper, And Screens.
